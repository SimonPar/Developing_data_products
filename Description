# This quick app exemplifies the regression to the mean phenomenon first outlined by Galton.
# It is doing this by 'predicting' the height of children based on their gender and the height of their parents.
# It is really easy. Go ahead and play with the sliders. This is an easy empirical and visual way to see what
# Galton meant when he scientifically outlined the notion of regression to the mean.
